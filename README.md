# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This is a repo containing some common data structures and algorithms implemented in C++.  

Licensed under BSD 3-Clause License.  
The code in this repo are some very common and fundamental concepts in modern computing,  
so I don't see the need to make this proprietary or copyleft.  
Everyone who properly learn Comp Sci should be able to reproduce the same ideas in code.  

I write this piece of code as a reinforcement of data structures and algorithms I learnt.  
I strongly discourage you to use any part of this in your data structures and algorithms courseworks / assignments.  
The best way to learn is by implementing it on your own once.  
It's the same as doing chemistry practicals / labs.  

If you need array lists for general computing, use std::vector instead.
