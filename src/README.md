# Abstract

## Introduction

This is a data structures and algorithms library for C++.

## Expected Environments

This library is written in minimal C++, that is,
without the use of any external libraries, not even C++ STL.
It could be used in general computing.
It performs well in embedded systems as they usually don't run in an OS, hence without STL.

## Licenses

This library is licensed under BSD 3-Clause License.  

The code in this repo are some very common and fundamental concepts in modern computing,
so I don't see the need to make this proprietary or copyleft.
Everyone who properly learn Comp Sci should be able to reproduce the same ideas in code.

## Reminder
I write this piece of code as a reinforcement of data structures and algorithms I learnt.
I strongly discourage you to use any part of this in your data structures and algorithms courseworks / assignments.
The best way to learn is by implementing it on your own once.
It's the same as doing chemistry practicals / labs.

## Issues
